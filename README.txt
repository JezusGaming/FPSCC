The unity project should be opened with unity 2019.2.0f1, 
the project has a demo level to test the features in the unity project as well as there being a player prefab which has variables that make the controller move around appropriately but can be changed easily to make it faster or slower.
All of the player options are on the player however there is a weapon sway script on the weapon to make is sway and get moved when sprinting that can be changed. 
The player also has the ability to strafe and b-hop leading to the player gaining extreme momentum. There are also some white cubes that can be pushed and shot around.
